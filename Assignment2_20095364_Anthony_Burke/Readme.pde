
 Brief description of the game developed: I have developed a shooting gallery where random targets will spawn after a set timer,
 and has a working lives system as well as the functionality to soft reset the game without needing to exit the program completely, the user controls a scope with the mouse and
 will look around to try and find targets in windows. if a target is hit the player will get a point and hear a gun shot sound, if the target is missed the player will hear a whooshing sound of
 a bullet missing and a life will be lost.
 
 Known bugs/problems: While not present on my main PC I have noticed that when I switch to my laptop I do not hear sounds playing, I'm not sure what is causing this but when I
 switch back to my main PC the sound works fine and all code is the same. Processing sometimes would give an error when trying to run the code but when tried again would run perfectly fine.
 I'm not sure if this is once again a problem with my laptop and processing or if it's a game issue, I haven't been able to determine this.
 
 If a player enters eg 10000 games in the input window the program makes it default to 5 and it will cause an Array out of bounds error at the end of the fifth round but if a player enter eg 7 and then the game sets it to 5 it will work fine with no errors.
